## Overview
The Callejo Inc. Childcare Website is a senior project undertaken by Tech Squad, a group of Computer Science students at California State University, Sacramento. Running from Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, this project is designed to support Jane Callejo's family-owned childcare business by creating an intuitive and efficient website.

This website will simplify key operations like managing child rosters, scheduling employees, and tracking expensesâ€”all tasks that currently take significant manual effort. By centralizing these processes, the website will save time, reduce errors, and help the childcare business run smoothly. Additionally, it will strengthen the connection between the business and parents by offering timely updates and clear communication.
