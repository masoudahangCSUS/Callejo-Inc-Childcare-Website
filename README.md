## Project Synopsis
The Callejo Inc. Childcare Website is an ongoing senior project being developed by Tech Squad, a team of Computer Science students at California State University, Sacramento. Running from Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, this project aims to support Jane Callejo’s family-owned childcare business by creating a user-friendly and effective website.

Our goal is to make daily operations at Callejo Inc. smoother and more efficient. Right now, tasks like managing child rosters, scheduling staff, and keeping track of business expenses are done manually, which takes time and can lead to mistakes. By building this website, we hope to centralize these processes, making them easier to manage and reducing the chance for errors. This will ultimately save time for the staff and allow them to focus more on what really matters—caring for the children.

We’re also focusing on making communication with parents easier and clearer. The website will provide timely updates and notifications so parents stay informed and connected. Through these features, we aim to create a reliable and organized system that supports the childcare center’s operations and builds trust with families. We're currently in the process of developing the website and are committed to delivering a tool that meets the needs of both the business and the parents it serves.

## Key Features
- **Feature 1**: User Experience
- **Feature 2**: Admin Controls 
- **Feature 3**: Database Management
*Add more features as needed.*

## Project Status
The software engineering team developed a comprehensive web application involving three main components: the frontend, backend, and database. For the frontend, we used Blazor, a framework for building interactive web UI with C# in conjuction with JavaScript, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Our team also employed HTML, CSS, to design the structure, style, and interactivity of the application, ensuring an intuitive user experience. Blazor enabled us to write both client-side and server-side code in C#, providing a seamless and consistent approach to frontend development. The backend was implemented using C#, handling the logic and operations that support the frontend. It served as the bridge between the frontend and the database, ensuring data is processed and sent to the user interface. For the database layer, MS SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) was used, where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. The team set up tables, relationships, and queries to handle data persistence efficiently. The entire application, including the frontend, backend, and database, will  be deployed on Azure, which provided a cloud infrastructure to host the application, manage scalability, and ensure reliability.
