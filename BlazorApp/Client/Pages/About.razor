            <p>
                Jane Callejo has been working with children of infant, toddler, and preschool ages since 1991. 
                At California State University, Sacramento, Jane worked at the childcare center as a student
                assistant for 3 years, assisting in providing care for admitted children at the center while
                pursuing a BA Degree in Art Education. After graduating, Jane continued to work in the childcare
                field until becoming a stay-at-home mom after becoming a mother of two. In 2005, Jane obtained a
                Family Childcare license and started a business in childcare. Today, Jane is a highly accomplished
                woman in not only her highly successful childcare business but in other fields as well, obtaining 
                her certification as a nursing assistant in 2016 and managing two rental homes in her rental business. 
                She is also currently working on an Airbnb business in the Philippines.
